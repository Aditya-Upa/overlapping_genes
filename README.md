 Conserved 4-nt Overlapping Genes in Prokaryotes: Evolutionary and Functional Insights

## Overview
This project investigates the prevalence, conservation, and potential functional/evolutionary significance of **exact 4-base pair (nt) overlapping genes** across prokaryotic species. Key findings include:
- **Cross-kingdom patterns**: High overlap percentages in archaea (*Haloferax volcanii*, 62%) and bacteria (*Bradyrhizobium*, 60.5%), with no correlation to genome size.
- **Substrain conservation**: 31 *Haloferax volcanii* substrains show remarkably stable overlap percentages (59â€“63%), suggesting strong evolutionary constraints.
- **Functional hypotheses**: Overlaps may optimize transcriptional coupling, genome compression, or mitigate transcriptional interference.
